# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 2: Full-Stack Web Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [specs/003-web-expansion/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Initial validation passes. The specification clearly defines the "what" and "why" for the Web Expansion phase without prescribing specific implementation libraries (though the high-level tech stack was mentioned in the input, the spec focuses on the functional requirements like JWT, REST, and persistence).
